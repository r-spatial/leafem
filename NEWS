  * added support for 'mapdeck' maps in addFeatures.
  * added methods addStarsImage (moved from mapview) and addRasterRGB. Thanks to Luigi Ranghetti #1.
  * addFeatures now also works with leaflet_proxy objects. Thanks Lorento Busetto #2.
  * new function addFgb to add flatgeobuf files from file or url.
  * addImageQuery now much more robust. Also works with leaflet_proxy objects now. Thanks to Sebastian Gatscha #9, #12, #13

miscellaneous:

  * garnishMap now uses match.arg and tries to be more robust.
